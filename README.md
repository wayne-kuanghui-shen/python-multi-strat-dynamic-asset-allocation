# *Integrating Fundamentals and Technicals: A Multi-Strategy Approach to Dynamic Asset Allocation*

**‚úèÔ∏è Introduction**: 

Traditional portfolio construction methods such as Markowitz (1952)'s Mean-Variance Model, in practice, often rely on the assumption of constant asset returns and covariance over time, regardless of the time-varying risks and returns of financial assets. The unending pursuit of the ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù of investing underscores the absence of a definitive optimal investment strategy. Given that existing literature focuses only on one dimension of factors, this study proposes a systematic multi-strategy approach for dynamic asset allocation strategies that integrates macroeconomic and technical signals.


## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Objectives 
- Build a dynamic asset allocation strategy that has the potential to outperform static portfolios
- Examine whether a multi-strategy framework would add value to asset allocation strategies
- Extend my previous [study](https://github.com/wayne-kuanghui-shen/python-spx_pricing_vecm_modeling), from determining pricing factors to building an investment strategy

## üìç Conclusions
- Findings: The multi-strategy dynamic portfolio outperforms static benchmarks out-of-sample
  - The dynamic portfolio strategy delivers a Sharpe ratio of 1.20, compared to 0.7 of classic 60/40 portfolio
  - The dynamic portfolio generates the highest absolute return and the lowest maximum drawdown vs. all benchmarks
  - The dynamic portfolio has an equity beta of only 0.37 and provides diversification benefits in recessionary regimes
  - The performance results are robust under different input and parameter settings in the model
- Implications: A superior framework for asset allocation strategy design
  - The inclusion of technical signals within a layered framework adds value to a macroeconomic-based portfolio strategy
  - Deriving the asset covariance based on the prevailing macro regime in mean-variance optimization enhances risk-adjusted returns
